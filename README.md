## 📌 Project Overview

This repository includes SQL files that cover:

- 🏗️ Database creation
- 📋 Table creation with constraints
- 🔗 Relationships (Primary Key / Foreign Key)
- ➕ Insert, Update, Delete operations
- 🔍 Data retrieval using SELECT queries
- 📊 Aggregate functions and joins

The project focuses on understanding relational database concepts and writing efficient SQL queries.
